        <h1> <u><strong> Chicken Makhani</strong> </u> </h1>

        <img src="images/Chicken_Makhani.jpg" alt=" A delicious bowl of Chicken Makhani" height="500px" >

        <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements 
            the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan 
            bread.</p>

            <p><b><h2>Directions to prepare:</h2></b></p>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p> 
                1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
            </p>  

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>
                Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.
            </p>    
            
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>
                Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>
                Serve over rice with naan.
